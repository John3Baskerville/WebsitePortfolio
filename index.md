### Spotify Song Clustering
**Can I use machine learning to create playlists using attributes from songs in my personal spotify library?**  

In this project I expriment with clustering algorithms to separate my personal spotify library into manageable and meaningful playlists. Spotify assigns each song with 13 calculated [audio features](https://developer.spotify.com/discover/) which I use for attributes when modling.

### Naming playlists using song names. 
**Use the song names from each playlist to generate a topic or playlist name**

I use the clusters generated from the Spotify Song Clustering project above as source data for a NLP model which uses the song names as training data.

### Predicting the winning team of a League of Legends match
I use data from 10,000 matches and identify important featues as well as develope models to predict the winning team of the match after 10 minutes play time.
