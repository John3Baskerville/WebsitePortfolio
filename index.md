### Spotify Song Clustering
Can I use machine learning to create playlists using songs from my personal spotify library?  
In this project I expriment with clustering algorithms to separate my personal spotify library into manageable and meaningful playlists. Spotify assigns each song with 13 calculated [audio features](https://developer.spotify.com/discover/) which I use for attributes when modling. I use [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.18.0/), a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API," to collect the my personal data.  and I chosee the 10 that I thought would help me most with clustering:

### Predicting the winning team of a League of Legends match
I use data from 10,000 matches and identify important featues as well as develope models to predict the winning team of the match after 10 minutes play time.
